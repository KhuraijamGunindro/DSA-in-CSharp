<h1>ðŸš©DSA in C#ðŸš©</h1>

This repository is about challenging myself to learn something new in C# DSA everyday. I'll start from the very basic data structures like arrays and move on to 
some more advanced topic like stack and all. And most importantly helping each other with learing DSA in C#.

<h2>The Reason I made this repository</h2> 

As I'm a C#/Dotnet developer I've always to do DSA with C# but there was a problem most of the DSA courses were mainly written in C++, python and Java.
So, I made my own C# DSA repository which will be improvised to a course later on.

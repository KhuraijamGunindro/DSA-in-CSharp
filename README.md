<h1>ðŸš©DSA in C#ðŸš©</h1>

This repository is about challenging myself to learn something new in C# DSA everyday. I'll start from the very basic data structures like arrays and move on to 
some more advanced topics like stacks and all. And most importantly it's about helping each other with learing DSA in C#.

<h3>âœ”What I'll include in this repository</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ðŸ“ŒProgram codes</li>
  <li>ðŸ“ŒExplanations</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸŽ´The Reason I made this repository</h2> 
As I'm a C#/Dotnet developer I've always wanted to do DSA with C# but there was a problem most of the DSA courses were mainly written in C++, python and Java.
So, I made my own C# DSA repository which will be improvised to a course later on.
